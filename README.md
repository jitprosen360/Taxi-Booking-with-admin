# Eber Ride - Taxi Booking Web App

## Description
Eber Ride is a Taxi Booking Web App built using the MEAN stack technology (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js). This project aims to provide a convenient and efficient solution for users to book taxis online and for drivers to manage their bookings effectively.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can create accounts and log in securely to access the booking functionality.
- **Search and Book Taxis**: Users can search for available taxis based on their location, view details such as driver information, ratings, and choose to book the taxi that suits their needs.
- **Real-time Tracking**: Once a booking is confirmed, users can track their taxi in real-time on a map, allowing them to know the driver's location and estimated time of arrival.
- **Multiple Payment Options**: The application supports multiple payment methods, providing users with flexibility and convenience.
- **Driver Management**: Drivers can create profiles, manage their availability, view assigned bookings, and update their status.
- **Rating and Feedback**: Users can rate their ride experience and provide feedback, helping to maintain a quality service.
- **Admin Dashboard**: An admin dashboard is available to manage users, drivers, bookings, and monitor system statistics.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing user and driver information, bookings, and other relevant data.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js used to build the server-side application logic and handle API requests.
- **Angular**: A powerful front-end framework used to develop the user interface, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used for server-side development and handling server operations.
- **Socket.IO**: A library enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients, facilitating live tracking and updates.
